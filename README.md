# Using Neural Networks to Achieve Optical Character Recognition

Computer Science BSc - Final Year Project. 

# Description

The aim of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of neural networks and how they can be used in order to achieve optical character recognition. This project will explore a range of areas regarding neural networks. A program will be created that Illustrates, through the use of datasets, how a neural network can be trained to recognize handwritten characters.

# Objectives 
• The project must demonstrate a knowledge of neural networks and how they operate.

• The project must explain and demonstrate how neural networks can be trained to improve the ability to recognize handwritten characters. This will be achieved through the facilitation
of existing datasets.

• The project must demonstrate the various OCR practices that need to be implemented in
order to optimise character recognition, such as pre-processing.

• The resulting program must be able to classify individual handwritten characters through the
use of a neural network.

• Different neural networks are created to compare the ability to achieve optical character
recognition between them.

• A dataset is created and used to train the neural network, with the aim of achieving optical
character recognition.
